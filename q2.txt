OOP: Object-oriented programming 

This aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming. 

The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate 
on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

There are some basic concepts of OOPs are:

Class
Object
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Polymorphism
Inheritance

Message Passing
